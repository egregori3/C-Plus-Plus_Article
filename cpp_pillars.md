The Four Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Encapsulation

"Preventing unauthorized access to some piece of information or functionality." https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/classes-and-objects

In my opinion, encapsulation (data hiding) is the most powerful feature of C++. 
It is good programming practice to always minimize scope;
variables should only be accessable by functions that require access.
C++ allows for variables to be bound directly to funcions within a class.
The programmer can specify the scope of a variable or function in a class using access specifiers (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/access).

Abstraction

https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-abstraction-in-programming

"Abstraction is used to hide background details or any unnecessary implementation about the data so that users only see the required information. It is one of the most important and essential features of object-oriented programming."

After you learn how to drive a car, you can "drive" almost any car. This is an example of abstraction. The brake, accelerator, and steering wheel are an interface to a black box. Once you learn to use the interface, you do not need to understand how the black box works in order to use it. The functioning of the car is abstracted from the user; only the interface is presented to the user.

procedural abstraction - "..  a “fence” around program segments, preventing some parts of the program from “seeing” how tasks are being accomplished.
modular abstraction - " ... a “screen” surrounding the internal structure of our program prohibiting programmers from accessing the data except through specified functions.
data abstraction - "With data abstraction we think about what operations can be performed on a particular type of data and not how it does it."


Polymorphism

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/polymorphism-in-c/

"The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form."

Polymorphism is a key 


Inheritance
